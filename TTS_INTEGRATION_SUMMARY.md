# TTS Integration Summary

## Problem
The TTS (Text-to-Speech) was working successfully in the AIBotPage but was not implemented in the vehicle/QR page chat assistant. The issue was that TTS was only implemented in the **voice endpoint** (`/api/daive/voice`) but not in the **chat endpoint** (`/api/daive/chat`).

## Solution
Added TTS functionality to the chat endpoint so that both AIBotPage and VehicleDetail pages can use the same backend TTS implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`src/routes/daive.js`)

**Added TTS to Chat Endpoint:**
- Added complete TTS implementation to the `/api/daive/chat` endpoint
- Supports multiple TTS providers: OpenAI, Deepgram, and ElevenLabs
- Uses global voice settings from the database
- Generates audio files and returns `audioResponseUrl` in the response

**TTS Provider Support:**
- **OpenAI TTS**: Uses `tts-1-hd` model with configurable voices (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
- **Deepgram TTS**: Uses Deepgram's speech synthesis API
- **ElevenLabs TTS**: Uses ElevenLabs API with Rachel voice (default)

### 2. Frontend Changes

**VehicleDetail.tsx:**
- Updated to use backend audio response when available
- Falls back to local speech generation if backend TTS is not available
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing voice functionality

**AIBotPage.tsx:**
- Already had proper audio playback functionality
- Uses `data.data.audioResponseUrl` from backend response
- Includes play/stop audio controls for each message

## How It Works

### Text Messages (Chat Endpoint)
1. User sends text message via chat interface
2. Backend processes the message with AI
3. If voice is enabled globally, backend generates TTS audio
4. Backend saves audio file and returns `audioResponseUrl`
5. Frontend displays message with audio playback button
6. User can click to play the generated audio

### Voice Messages (Voice Endpoint)
1. User records voice message
2. Backend transcribes audio to text
3. Backend processes with AI
4. Backend generates TTS response audio
5. Frontend displays both transcription and response with audio

## Configuration

### Voice Settings (Global)
- `voice_enabled`: Enable/disable TTS globally
- `voice_tts_provider`: Choose TTS provider (openai, deepgram, elevenlabs)
- `voice_provider`: Alternative provider setting
- `voice_openai_voice`: OpenAI voice selection

### API Keys Required
- `openai_key`: For OpenAI TTS
- `deepgram_key`: For Deepgram TTS  
- `elevenlabs_key`: For ElevenLabs TTS

## Testing

Created `test-tts-integration.js` to verify:
- TTS functionality in chat endpoint
- TTS functionality in voice endpoint
- Audio file generation and URL response

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Both pages now use the same TTS implementation
2. **Performance**: Backend TTS is more efficient than client-side generation
3. **Quality**: Server-side TTS provides better audio quality
4. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple TTS providers with easy switching
5. **Reliability**: Centralized TTS reduces client-side dependencies

## Usage

### For Users
- Text messages automatically generate audio responses when voice is enabled
- Voice messages work with both speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Audio playback controls are available for all assistant messages

### For Developers
- TTS is handled entirely on the backend
- Frontend only needs to display `audioResponseUrl` and provide playback controls
- Easy to add new TTS providers by extending the backend logic

## Files Modified

1. `src/routes/daive.js` - Added TTS to chat endpoint
2. `src/pages/VehicleDetail.tsx` - Updated to use backend audio response
3. `test-tts-integration.js` - Created test script
4. `TTS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with real API keys
2. Monitor audio file storage and cleanup
3. Consider adding audio caching for repeated responses
4. Add voice settings UI for users to configure TTS preferences
