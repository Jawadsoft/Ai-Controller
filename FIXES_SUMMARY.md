# Database Query Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dealers Routes (`src/routes/dealers.js`)**
**Problems:**
- ❌ Using `db.query` instead of imported `query` function
- ❌ Missing authentication middleware on profile routes
- ❌ Variable name conflicts

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Changed all `db.query` to `query`
- ✅ Added `authenticateToken` middleware to profile routes
- ✅ Fixed import statement to include `authenticateToken`

### 2. **Vehicles Routes (`src/routes/vehicles.js`)**
**Problems:**
- ❌ Variable name conflict: `query` used as both imported function and local variable
- ❌ This caused `query(query, params)` which would fail

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Renamed local variables from `query` to `sqlQuery`
- ✅ Fixed all instances in GET routes for vehicles list and single vehicle

### 3. **Leads Routes (`src/routes/leads.js`)**
**Problems:**
- ❌ Same variable name conflict as vehicles routes
- ❌ `query` used as both imported function and local variable

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Renamed local variables from `query` to `sqlQuery`
- ✅ Fixed all instances in GET routes for leads list and single lead

### 4. **Admin Routes (`src/routes/admin.js`)**
**Problems:**
- ❌ Using `db.query` instead of imported `query` function
- ❌ Multiple instances throughout the file

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Changed all `db.query` to `query`
- ✅ Fixed in user management routes (create, update, delete)
- ✅ Fixed in admin stats route
- ✅ Fixed transaction handling (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

### 5. **Database Migration (`src/database/migrate.js`)**
**Problems:**
- ❌ Using `db.query` instead of imported `query` function

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Changed import to destructure `query` function
- ✅ Updated function call from `db.query` to `query`

## Files Modified

1. **`src/routes/dealers.js`** - Fixed database queries and added authentication
2. **`src/routes/vehicles.js`** - Fixed variable name conflicts
3. **`src/routes/leads.js`** - Fixed variable name conflicts
4. **`src/routes/admin.js`** - Fixed all database queries
5. **`src/database/migrate.js`** - Fixed import and function call

## Root Cause

The main issue was inconsistent usage of the database connection:
- Some files imported `query` function correctly but used `db.query`
- Some files had variable name conflicts where `query` was used for both the imported function and local SQL strings
- Missing authentication middleware on some routes

## Testing

After applying all fixes:
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ All database queries now use the correct `query` function
- ✅ Authentication middleware properly applied
- ✅ Variable name conflicts resolved

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use consistent import patterns: `import { query } from '../database/connection.js'`
2. Avoid using `query` as a variable name when importing the `query` function
3. Use descriptive variable names like `sqlQuery` for SQL strings
4. Ensure all protected routes have proper authentication middleware
5. Test all routes after making changes

## Current Status

All 500 errors related to database queries should now be resolved. The application should work properly for:
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Dealer profile management
- Vehicle management
- Lead management
- Admin functions
