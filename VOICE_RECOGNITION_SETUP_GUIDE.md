node test-api-settings.js

# Test voice recognition
node test-voice-recognition.js

# Test voice endpoint
node test-voice-simple.js
```

## Database Configuration

Voice settings are stored in the `daive_api_settings` table:

```sql
-- Check voice settings for a dealer
SELECT setting_type, setting_value 
FROM daive_api_settings 
WHERE dealer_id = 'your-dealer-id' 
AND setting_type LIKE 'voice_%';

-- Check API keys
SELECT setting_type, setting_value 
FROM daive_api_settings 
WHERE dealer_id = 'your-dealer-id' 
AND setting_type IN ('openai_key', 'elevenlabs_key');
```

## API Endpoints

### Voice Settings
```http
GET /api/daive/voice-settings
POST /api/daive/voice-settings
```

### Voice Processing
```http
POST /api/daive/voice
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### API Settings
